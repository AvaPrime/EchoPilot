# EchoPilot Comprehensive Action Plan

**Created:** January 2025  
**Status:** Active Implementation Plan  
**Based on:** Repository Review, Progress Dashboard, Implementation Checklist  
**Target Completion:** 8 weeks

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive action plan addresses the critical gaps identified in the EchoPilot VS Code extension, transforming it from a 0% complete state to production-ready within 8 weeks. The plan prioritizes testing infrastructure, security vulnerabilities, and error handling as foundational elements before advancing to quality improvements and enhancements.

### Key Insights from Analysis
- **Current State:** Well-structured architecture but 0% implementation progress
- **Critical Blockers:** No testing framework, security vulnerabilities, missing error handling
- **Opportunity:** Strong foundation allows rapid progress once infrastructure is established
- **Risk:** Without immediate action on critical items, project remains indefinitely blocked
